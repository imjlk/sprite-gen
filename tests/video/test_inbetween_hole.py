"""A hole through a limb (docs/loop-repair.md section 4): `rife.hole` reads the transparent holes a made frame opened
inside its silhouette that neither source frame beside it has there, and the cycle alignment gives such a frame way to
the nearer source frame (`--between auto`). RIFE runs a frame's colour and its coverage apart, and the coverage run can
carry the gap one source frame has between two legs into a leg the colour run keeps whole: a transparent band through the
leg with its fill on both sides. Nothing is added, no part coverage is left, and around the band the leg's own fill is
all the line there is — the outline readings judge an outline, not a hole. A hole of the frame between is the source
frames' own where either has a pixel under solid within 4 px of where it lay, in place or carried by the whole figure's
motion — a gap kept, moved with the body, or opened by a step between two legs — or where it is, whatever carried it,
one hole of each source frame: alike in area, in shape and in the colour round it, and on its way between theirs. So a
hole a part carries over a body that stays, turned, grown, sheared or swung, is theirs. A hole the first two readings
give the source frames takes no pair; of the holes they leave, each source frame's hole is one hole of the frame
between, and of the sets of pairs the one taken pairs the most, so alike holes whose ways run near each other each keep
their own two. A hole more than they have among the holes left is given way, and so is a hole unlike theirs, off its
way or farther than the figure's motion is followed, and a gap only one source frame opens on a part the figure's
motion does not carry, which the reading does not tell from a band the coverage run carried out of one source frame's
gap. A hole more is read as theirs where it lies within 4 px of a hole of theirs, or where it pairs with one source
frame's hole and the other's alike hole whose own holes the first two readings explain: what the reading does not tell.

The fixtures are synthetic: a figure of rectangles outlined in black, legs filled dark (under the dark line, 70/255,
as dark tights or boots are), the near leg over the far one; the first source frame with its legs side by side, the
second with a gap between them, as a step opens it; a gap between the arm and the body in every frame. Then a body with
a gap through it, moved whole; a figure whose legs part above boots that close the gap below, still and moving; a body
that stays with a part on it, a hole through the part, moved; the same over a body patterned in stripes or checks; a
torso patterned in blocks with an arm beside it, the gap between them moving with the arm; a plate with a gap through it,
turned, grown, sheared or swung over a body that stays; a plate with a row of holes; a row of holes moving on a curved
way; a column of holes; a plate with a hole one source frame keeps in place beside a hole moving between them; and a
body moving whole with a gap or a row of holes through it."""
