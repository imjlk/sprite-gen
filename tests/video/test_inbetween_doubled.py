"""A double outline (docs/loop-repair.md section 4): `rife.doubled` reads a line one source frame draws that a made frame
left at part strength in its own place, and the cycle alignment gives such a frame way to the nearer source frame
(`--between auto`). Where RIFE's flow does not follow a line — the top of a boot one source frame tilts and the other
plants — it can fade the line out instead of moving it, and the frame shows it, lighter, beside the line it drew. Its
coverage is whole, nothing darker is added and its edge keeps its line, so the ghost screen, the smear and both outline
readings pass it; the cross-fade reading names whole drawings blended, and is no fault. A line both source frames draw
within 4 px is theirs, at any strength; a line the made frame carries at its source frame's own strength is that frame's
drawing; the soft edge of a line the flow moved lies beside the line at full strength; a line left less than 50/255
darker than the other source frame shows there is not seen; a run shorter than 3 % of the body is not read. A line only
one source frame draws — a crease that comes and goes — is read the same way: left at part strength, it is a double
outline too.

The fixtures are synthetic: a coat over two legs in boots, outlined 3 px in near-black, with a hand beside the coat; the
near boot lifted 18 px in the first source frame and planted in the second. The frame drawn between, and the same with a
source frame's near-boot lines laid over it at part strength; blurred, smeared along the step; a hand moving 60 px over
the coat; boots drawn with a second line; a hem drawn with two lines and softened; a crease one source frame draws. And
the walker of tests/video/test_crossfade.py: its drawing between far-apart drawings, and its cross-fades."""
